Repository du projet de la s√©rie de tutoriels Activateur Web sur la construction d'un site e-commerce en JavaScript.
This is the front end and back end server for Project E-Commerce with JavaScript Vanilla on frontend.
Tutorial series to be found on the Activeur Web blog.(https://activateurweb.com/blog)
We will see how to use the API, and load our elements dynamically on the different pages of the site.

### Back end Prerequisites ###
You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

1 - Clone this repo. 
2 - From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`.
3 - You can then run the server with `nodemon server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
